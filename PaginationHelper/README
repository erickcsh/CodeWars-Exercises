For this exercise you will be strengthening your page-fu mastery. You will complete the PaginationHelper class, which is a utility class helpful for querying paging information related to an array.

The class is designed to take in an array of values and an integer indicating how many items will be allowed per each page. The types of values contained within the collection/array are not relevant.

The following are some examples of how this class is used:

helper = PaginationHelper.new([1,2,3,4,5,6], 4)
helper.page_count # should == 2
helper.item_count # should == 6
helper.page_item_count(0)  # should == 4
helper.page_item_count(1) # last page - should == 2
helper.page_item_count(2) # should == -1 since the page is invalid

helper.page_index(5) # should == 1 (zero based index)
helper.page_index(2) # should == 0
helper.page_index(20) # should == -1
helper.page_index(-10) # should == -1



My Comments: I have not posted this solution at the page because it is supposed that -1 as an index is consider out of range but I use it as Ruby use it, so I had this problem all the way through passing the tests.
