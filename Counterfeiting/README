Your counterfeit method will be passed a coin object and a block called spend. Calling spend with coin (spend.(coin) or yield coin) should only work once; spending it again should raise an error. Can you counterfeit a new coin to spend, or trick spend into accepting coin more than once?

The default test is the same as the real one.
